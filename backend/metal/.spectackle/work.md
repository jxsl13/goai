## ADR-01M0FVWNPKEX6917B1N0VBM0FJ How should synchronous host-resident F32 Metal bias gradients route after the CPU reduction optimization?
kind: adr
state: done
created: 2026-08-20
context: Three independent count-7 M2 campaigns show the production CPU selector is 3.263x to 199.71x faster than direct Metal through 2,097,152 elements, with worst candidate spread 1.788x, exact reference parity, and 0.994x end-to-end GPT throughput.
decision: Route measured shapes through CPU and preserve direct Metal above the bound
consequences: F32 rank-2 gradients with positive dimensions and at most 2,097,152 elements use the exact optimized CPU kernel with recorder suppression. Larger, unsupported, or CPU-unavailable cases retain the isolated direct Metal implementation. Future device-resident graph execution requires a new benchmark boundary and does not inherit this host-resident decision.
status: accepted

kind: radio
option: Route measured shapes through CPU and preserve direct Metal above the bound
option: Retain direct Metal for all shapes
option: Remove the direct Metal implementation
blocks: T-01M0FVGM88EWMRQCHFN4B748AV
choice: Route measured shapes through CPU and preserve direct Metal above the bound

## ADR-01M0M9MPAGFM9T4AMA7D97HWJD Which native Metal Q4_1 kernel shape should be the production baseline on M2?
kind: adr
state: done
created: 2026-08-22
context: Q4_1 uses a 20-byte affine block with d and m. Direct decoding preserves compressed residency and avoids transformation traffic. Q4_0 already proves the scalar and cooperative occupancy shapes.
decision: Separate scalar and two-SIMD-group cooperative pipelines derived from Q4_0
consequences: The kernel decodes Q4_1 directly from 20-byte resident blocks. Synchronous, resident, and recorder paths share the same cached pipelines. Scalar is the capability fallback; cooperative is the M2 path. No dense expansion or transient Q4_0 transformation is allowed.
status: accepted

kind: radio
option: Separate scalar and two-SIMD-group cooperative pipelines derived from Q4_0
option: Reuse Q4_0 after transforming Q4_1 weights or activations
option: Materialize dense F32 weights before Metal GEMM
blocks: P-01M0M9B6FRFCZA18408PMM2WGH
choice: Separate scalar and two-SIMD-group cooperative pipelines derived from Q4_0
