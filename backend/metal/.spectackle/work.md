## T-01KYJREJ34FN9BEZDREAF6WYT8 Fix the broken BenchmarkGPTDecode — it blocks honest sizing of dispatch work
kind: task
state: draft
created: 2026-07-27

BLOCKER, not an optimization. Small, but it gates a whole line of work.

SITE: backend/metal/gpt_test.go:303 BenchmarkGPTDecode.

SYMPTOM: it fails on both sub-benchmarks with: nlp: DecodeStep position 8 does not continue the cache: the next token is at position 9 (cached rows: 9).

WHY IT MATTERS: this is the ONLY benchmark in the tree that measures per-op dispatch cost at decode shapes (seq=1). Prefill benchmarks cannot see it — the researching agent measured BenchmarkGPTForward/metal at 29 ms for roughly 93 ops, so about 200 ns/op of dispatch overhead is 0.06%, i.e. invisible. At decode shapes the same fixed cost is roughly 10% (BenchmarkGemmaDecode averages 406 ns per Execute at dim=16). Without this benchmark the Execute-memoization task cannot be honestly sized, and any claim about it would be an estimate dressed as a measurement.

FIX: diagnose the position/cache-row mismatch. The error says the loop advanced position to 8 while the cache already held 9 rows, so either the benchmark seeds the cache with a prompt and then restarts positions from a stale index, or it reuses one cache across b.N iterations without resetting. Establish which before changing anything — the fix is either resetting per iteration or deriving the position from the cache length rather than from a counter.

VALIDATION: the benchmark runs to completion on both sub-benchmarks and produces a stable tok/s figure across -count=3. Then confirm it actually exercises the intended regime by checking with GOAI_TIME_OPS=1 that per-token Execute counts match the model's layer count, so it is measuring decode and not accidentally re-running prefill.

SCOPE: fix the harness only. Do not optimize anything in the same change — the entire point is to obtain a trustworthy measuring instrument before optimizing, and a benchmark repaired in the same commit as the thing it measures cannot serve as the A/B baseline.

targets: go:metal.addBiasBackwardF32, backend/metal/metal_test.go

Add a mutation-proven direct-Metal benchmark control and production selector over the frozen F32 shape matrix. Run three independent count-7 campaigns, reject unstable timing before routing, pin both selector arms, strengthen contiguous and noncontiguous reference parity, run an end-to-end GPT training-step no-regression gate, and retain only a measured winner zone. Record reproducible evidence and update perfscan issue 773 with the Metal sibling finding.
